## Project-2-Presentation

<h1>Film Fusion</h1>

<p>
      The objective was to build a website using the following technologies :
      HTML, CSS, React JS, and fetching data from an API.
</p>

<p>
      We had four weeks to do it. Two dedicated to the project conception using
      agile methods, and two weeks devoted to the development.
</p>

<p>
      We did a website about movies and decided to stand out by setting up a
      forum section where users and guests can discuss and chat together to find
      ideas or just about their passion.
</p>

<p>
      I invite you to check
